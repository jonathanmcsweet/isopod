# Isopod

[![CI](https://github.com/jonathanmcsweet/isopod/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jonathanmcsweet/isopod/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

`isopod` is a bash script that creates a Podman (or Docker) container with an SSH server inside, puts your code in it, and turns [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) into a GUI for that container. 

The IDE's server component, your terminals, and any AI agent extensions all execute inside the container. This favors copying and exporting to your local host vs binding to a folder to prevent access to your local file system. Includes hardening that limits hardware fingerprinting.

Each sandbox gets its own window color to discern between environments and other VSCodium windows.

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```sh
brew tap jonathanmcsweet/isopod
brew install isopod          # or: brew install --HEAD isopod  (latest master)
```

The formula lives in the separate [`homebrew-isopod`](https://github.com/jonathanmcsweet/homebrew-isopod)
tap and installs `bash`/`zsh` shell completions. You still need a container engine
(`brew install podman`). See [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) for how the tap is created
and maintained.

### install.sh (any Linux/macOS, no Homebrew)

```sh
./install.sh            # per-user install, no sudo
./install.sh --system   # system-wide (/usr/local), needs sudo
./install.sh --check     # show what the installer will do
./install.sh --uninstall # remove a previous install
```

`install.sh` also drops in shell completions (best-effort) and points your editor
at the `Open Remote – SSH` extension. Tab-completion covers subcommands, options,
and your existing box names.

## Quick start

```sh
# Sandbox around a git repo, teal-tinted windows
isopod create myproj --repo https://github.com/me/myproj --color teal
isopod code myproj          # opens VSCodium connected to the container

# Sandbox from an explicit allowlist of host folders to copy
isopod create scratch --copy ~/src/lib-a --copy ~/notes/specs --color '#b3261e'
isopod code scratch --app cursor

# Day-to-day
isopod list
isopod shell myproj                 # terminal inside the container
isopod copy-in myproj ~/datasets/x  # add more host folders later (still a copy)
isopod export myproj ./out          # pull the whole workspace back out (files)
isopod fetch myproj                 # pull the container's git history into a host clone
isopod remap myproj --name "Me" --email me@x.com  # fix container commit identity after fetch
isopod stop myproj
isopod rm myproj                    # destroy container + its keys + ssh config entry
```

## The isolation model

The container cannot see the host filesystem at all. Files cross the boundary in five ways:

1. `--repo <url>` — a `git clone` executed *inside* the container.
2. `--copy <path>` / `isopod copy-in` — a one-time **copy** of folders you name.
3. `isopod export` to copy changes back to the host machine
4. `isopod fetch` git history copied back to your local machine
5. `git push` to your remote server

We have some mitigations for a snooping AI agent fingerprinting your host machine from the container. It sees the container's hostname, a generic Linux environment, and the container's network identity — and isopod masks the host-revealing `/proc`/`/sys` paths it would otherwise read (drive serials, board model, MACs, boot UUIDs — see [Fingerprint hardening](#fingerprint-hardening)). Additional details:

- SSH is bound to `127.0.0.1` only and uses a dedicated per-container ed25519 keypair with the container's host key pinned. Password auth and root login are disabled in the container's sshd.
- **SSH agent forwarding and X11 forwarding are explicitly disabled** in the generated config, so an agent inside the container cannot borrow your SSH agent to authenticate as you elsewhere.
- With rootless Podman (the recommended engine), even "root" inside the container is just your unprivileged user on the host, remapped.

**To create an offline container** `ISOPOD_RUN_ARGS="--network=none" isopod create ...`


### What it does NOT protect against

- **Network exfiltration of what's inside the container.** AI agents need network access (APIs, package installs), so the container has it unless youv'e created an offline container. Anything you copy into the container could be sent out by a misbehaving agent. Only put code/data in the container that you could tolerate leaking, and use narrowly-scoped credentials. 

- **A misbehaving agent inside the container.** By default the in-container user has **passwordless `sudo`** (so agents can `apt install` toolchains), which makes the agent effectively root *within the container*. Your host is still protected by the isolation model above — but anything inside the container (including data you copied in) is fully exposed to it. If you don't need in-container package installs, create the container with **`--no-sudo`** to drop that privilege. The container also intentionally keeps Linux capabilities (no `--cap-drop=ALL`), since `sshd` and `sudo` need them — see [Fingerprint hardening](#fingerprint-hardening).

- **Container escape.** Containers share the host kernel. Rootless Podman makes escapes very hard, but a container is not a VM. For "agent might be actively malicious and sophisticated," use a full VM. For "agent might do dumb destructive things or over-collect data" this is the right tool.

- **Docker's daemon model.** With Docker (non-rootless), the daemon runs as root; a compromise of the daemon is a compromise of the host. Enable Docker rootless mode to avoid this.

## Fingerprint hardening

A container shares the host's kernel and hardware, so by default a process inside can read a surprising amount about the host through `/proc` and `/sys` — far more than its own hostname. Isopod ships a hardening profile that closes the file-based leaks and supports an optional sandboxed runtime for the rest. The shipped defaults live in **[`security/hardening.conf`](security/hardening.conf)** — a read-only baseline you don't edit (package upgrades replace it). To customize, drop an override file at **`~/.config/isopod/hardening.conf`** that *layers* on top of the baseline with `mask` / `unmask` / `runtime` / `no-runtime` directives (so you keep getting new masks on upgrade), or toggle the runtime per-run with `ISOPOD_RUNTIME=runsc`.

### What's implemented

Every container hides the host-revealing paths below. Podman gets a single `--security-opt mask=…`; Docker (which has no mask flag) gets an empty `tmpfs` per directory and a `/dev/null` bind per file.

| Masked path | Data it obfuscates |
|---|---|
| `/proc/cmdline` | host boot args — **LUKS volume UUID, root-fs UUID, OS image / ostree hash** |
| `/proc/modules` | loaded host kernel modules (VPNs like WireGuard, DisplayLink, Bluetooth…) |
| `/sys/class/dmi`, `/sys/devices/virtual/dmi`, `/sys/firmware` | SMBIOS: **board model, vendor, BIOS version/date** |
| `/sys/bus/pci` | full host PCI topology (NVMe, Wi-Fi, USB4/Thunderbolt controllers) |
| `/sys/bus/usb` | attached peripherals **with serial numbers** (keyboard, mouse, NIC, dongles) |
| `/sys/class/net` | interface names and **MAC addresses** |
| `/sys/block`, `/sys/class/nvme` | disk models and **factory drive serial numbers** |
| `/sys/class/hwmon`, `/sys/class/thermal`, `/sys/class/drm` | sensor/thermal/GPU identity (a board signature) |

Verify from inside a container: after hardening, `cat /proc/cmdline` and `lsblk -o NAME,SERIAL` come back empty/blank.

> isopod launches containers with `podman run`/`docker run`, not Compose, so the profile above is the live source of truth. If you prefer Compose, [`security/compose.yaml`](security/compose.yaml) expresses the same masks in `podman compose`/`docker compose` form as a reference — it is not executed by the CLI.

> isopod deliberately does **not** add `--cap-drop=ALL`, `--read-only`, or `--security-opt no-new-privileges` here: the container runs `sshd` and gives agents passwordless `sudo apt install` for toolchains, all of which those flags would break. The isolation guarantees in [The isolation model](#the-isolation-model) (no mounts, loopback-only SSH, rootless userns) remain the primary boundary; the masks above are defense-in-depth against *fingerprinting* specifically.

### Opt-in Security Features
See **[docs/opt-in-security.md](docs/opt-in-security.md)** for how to enable and configure them.

### What still can't be mitigated

Even with every mask on, a **plain shared-kernel container cannot hide these** — the app reads them straight from the CPU or the shared kernel, with no file to mask:

- **CPU identity** — model, family, stepping, **microcode**, feature flags, via the `CPUID` instruction. (Masking `/proc/cpuinfo` doesn't stop `CPUID` and breaks build tools, so isopod leaves it readable.)
- **Kernel build string** — `uname -r` always returns the host kernel version.
- **Host boot epoch / boot id** — `/proc/stat`'s `btime` and `/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id` are a single value per host boot, identical in every container on that host. (`btime` is left unmasked because masking `/proc/stat` breaks `top`/`htop` and most monitoring.)
- **Timing side channels** — `RDTSC` and clock-skew fingerprints.

A **Tier 3 microVM runtime** (Kata or krun) does close these — the box runs on its own guest kernel behind a hardware boundary, so `uname`, boot id, and the timing channels reflect the VM, not the host. See [docs/opt-in-security.md](docs/opt-in-security.md#microvm-runtimes-kata-krun--tier-3).

Rule of thumb: if your threat model is "a sophisticated, actively malicious agent," use a Tier 3 microVM runtime (or a full VM); isopod's container hardening targets "an agent that over-collects host data or does dumb destructive things."
## Requirements

- Linux (primary), macOS (via `podman machine` or Docker Desktop), or Windows (via WSL2 — see [docs/installation-and-platform.md](docs/installation-and-platform.md#windows))
- `podman` (recommended) or `docker`
- `ssh`, `ssh-keygen`, `ssh-keyscan` (the standard OpenSSH client tools)
- VSCodium with the **Open Remote – SSH** extension (`jeanp413.open-remote-ssh`, on Open VSX). `isopod code` installs it for you if missing. Cursor/Windsurf/VS Code ship their own Remote-SSH.

Run `isopod doctor` to check your setup.

### Manual installation

Don't use Homebrew or `install.sh`? Per-platform manual install steps (Fedora,
immutable Fedora, Debian/Ubuntu, system-wide, macOS, Windows/WSL2) and how to
verify and update an install live in
**[docs/installation-and-platform.md](docs/installation-and-platform.md)**.

Every container also becomes a plain SSH host: `ssh isopod-myproj` works from any terminal, and any SSH-aware tool can use it.

## Getting work back out: `export` vs `fetch`

Two ways out, for two situations:

Both run over the box's SSH connection, so the box must be **running** (`isopod start <name>` if not). `export` and `copy-in` move files as a tar stream, preserving timestamps, modes, and symlinks.

- **`isopod export <name> [dest]`** copies the container's whole working tree (including its `.git`) to a fresh host directory. It will not write into an existing path so the export shape stays predictable.
- **`isopod fetch <name> [target-repo]`** brings only **committed git history** across, the clean way — no file merges, no clobbering your working tree:

  ```sh
  cd ~/code/myproj          # an existing clone on your host
  isopod fetch myproj        # target defaults to the current directory
  ```

  Under the hood it `git fetch`es straight from the container over its SSH remote (the same dedicated key and pinned host key isopod already set up) — so the container's branches appear as **remote-tracking refs named `<name>/*`** without touching your local branches. Check one out with:

  ```sh
  git switch -c fingerprint-hardening myproj/fingerprint-hardening
  ```

  `isopod fetch` finds the repo at the container's workspace automatically (or the single git subfolder inside it); pass `--path <in-container-repo>` if your layout is unusual. If the target isn't a git repo, it instead drops a `<name>.bundle` file and prints how to use it (this fallback needs git ≥ 2.36 in the box — the default base has it). Like `export`, it needs no network and no git remote.


  `isopod remap <name> [target-repo]` Pods don't set a git identity, so commits made inside one carry whatever was configured there (often a throwaway `dev@<container>`); this maps them to your real name/email while preserving commit messages and author/committer **dates**:

  ```sh
  isopod remap myproj --name "Ada Lovelace" --email ada@example.com
  ```

  Only commits matching the old identity are touched — pass `--old-email <e>` (and optionally `--old-name <n>`) to set it explicitly, or let it auto-detect from the still-running container. The new identity defaults to your host `git config` (override with `--name`/`--email` or `ISOPOD_GIT_NAME`/`ISOPOD_GIT_EMAIL`), so the common case is just `isopod remap myproj`. To remap several identities at once, list `old -> new` rules in `--remap-file <file>` (or `~/.config/isopod/remap`). The rewrite is scoped to the container's `<name>/*` refs, so **your own branches are never touched**, and the originals are snapshotted under `refs/remap-backup/` so you can undo. It uses [`git-filter-repo`](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) when installed, otherwise a built-in `git fast-export`→`fast-import` rewrite that needs only **core git plus `python3`**. See **[docs/remap.md](docs/remap.md)** for the full details.

## Connecting each IDE

**VSCodium (priority).** `isopod code <name>` checks for `jeanp413.open-remote-ssh`, installs it from Open VSX if needed, and launches `codium --folder-uri vscode-remote://ssh-remote+isopod-<name>/home/dev/workspace`. The first connection downloads the VSCodium server *into the container*. Extensions you install in that window (including AI agents like Cline, Continue, Roo, etc.) install and run in the container.

**Cursor / Windsurf / VS Code.** `isopod code <name> --app cursor` (or `windsurf`, `code`). They use the same SSH host entry; their bundled Remote-SSH handles the rest. Note that Cursor's own cloud AI features run wherever Cursor sends them, but the agent's *tool execution* (shell commands, file edits) happens in the container.

**JetBrains.** Open JetBrains Gateway → SSH connection → pick host `isopod-<name>` (it reads your `~/.ssh/config`) → project directory `/home/dev/workspace`. The JetBrains backend IDE runs inside the container. Note the default image is slim; JetBrains backends want more: create with `--memory 6g` and run `isopod shell <name>` then `sudo apt install -y libxext6 libxrender1 libxtst6 libxi6 fontconfig` if the backend complains.

## Environment variables

`ISOPOD_ENGINE` (`podman`|`docker`) — engine override. 
`ISOPOD_CONFIG_DIR` — state location (default `~/.config/isopod`). 
`ISOPOD_BUILD_ARGS` — extra args for `build` (e.g. `--network=host`, 
`--build-arg http_proxy=...` behind corporate proxies). 
`ISOPOD_RUN_ARGS` — extra args for `run` (e.g. `--network=none` for an offline container, `--userns=keep-id`, custom DNS).
`ISOPOD_RUNTIME` — sandboxed runtime overriding the hardening profile: Tier 2 (`runsc`) or a Tier 3 microVM (`kata`, `krun`; needs `/dev/kvm`).
`ISOPOD_MICROVM_MEMORY` — default guest memory when a Tier 3 microVM runtime is active and no `--memory` is given (default `2g`). 
`ISOPOD_HARDENING_CONF` — path to an alternate baseline [fingerprint-hardening profile](#fingerprint-hardening) (advanced; for per-user tweaks layer an override at `~/.config/isopod/hardening.conf` instead).

## Customizing the container

The base image is defined by a standard Dockerfile, [`share/Dockerfile`](share/Dockerfile) — built identically by `docker build` and `podman build`. On top of whatever base you choose it adds sshd, git, common CLI tooling, the unprivileged in-container user, and passwordless sudo (drop sudo with `--no-sudo`). There are two ways to shape it:

- **`--image <ref>`** swaps the base. Any Debian/Ubuntu-based image works (`--image ubuntu:24.04`), including one you built yourself from a Dockerfile and want to reuse across boxes.
- **`--dockerfile <path>`** is the project-provisioning path: isopod builds your Dockerfile first, then layers sshd/git on top (i.e. your image becomes the base via `FROM`). This is how you bake in a toolchain (a JDK, Node, etc.) the industry-standard way, rather than a bespoke config format.

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile  — your project's toolchain
FROM debian:bookworm-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends default-jdk maven
```

```sh
isopod create api --repo https://github.com/me/api --dockerfile ./Dockerfile
```

Your Dockerfile must use a Debian/Ubuntu (`apt`) base, since isopod's layer installs sshd with `apt-get`. A trailing `USER` in your Dockerfile doesn't change the box's privilege model — isopod's layer resets to root (sshd must be PID 1 as root) and you log in as the unprivileged in-box user. **To limit privilege inside the box, use `--no-sudo`** (drops the in-box user's passwordless sudo), not the base image's `USER` — isopod's SSH model supersedes it. (isopod's real boundary is host isolation + rootless userns, not in-container rootlessness; see [The isolation model](#the-isolation-model).)

Because the image is built before the container exists (and `--repo` clones *inside* the box afterward), the Dockerfile is a host-side file you point at — not something read from the cloned repo. For quick one-offs you can still install toolchains interactively with `isopod shell`.

isopod runs box operations (clone, copy-in, export, fetch) over a non-interactive SSH command, which uses the system `PATH`, not the one your `~/.bashrc` builds. Install tools system-wide (in the Dockerfile, or with `sudo` in the box) so these operations can find them; a tool only on a shell-rc `PATH` is still available in `isopod shell`, just not to box operations.

### Reaching a server in the box (port forwarding)

A dev server inside the box (say `pnpm run start` on `:3000`) isn't on your host by default. Publish it with **`--expose`**, which maps a container port to a `127.0.0.1` host port — the standard `podman/docker run -p`, loopback-only:

```sh
isopod create web --repo <url> --expose 3001:3000   # box :3000 -> localhost:3001
isopod create web --repo <url> --expose 8080         # same port on both sides
```

Port mappings are set at create time (engine port mappings can't be added to a *running* container) and restored across stop/start. `isopod info <name>` lists them. To add or change ports later without starting over, use `isopod reconfigure` (below). In the VSCodium Remote-SSH window, ports a server opens are also auto-forwarded by the IDE.

### Changing a box after create (`reconfigure`)

A container's run settings — ports, memory, cpus, fingerprint masks — can't be edited in place; the engine bakes them in at creation. So every box has a readable config you can change, and isopod re-applies it for you:

```sh
isopod config web                       # view the box's config.yaml
isopod reconfigure web --expose 5173 --memory 8g   # or edit config.yaml, then:
isopod reconfigure web
```

The config lives at `~/.config/isopod/boxes/<name>/config.yaml` — and it's written as a **real, valid Compose service** (engine-correct: podman gets `security_opt: mask=…`, docker gets `tmpfs`/`/dev/null` binds), so you can read, copy, or adapt it elsewhere. But **isopod owns and parses it; it does not launch boxes from it** — a working box also needs the per-box SSH key, pinned host key, and cloned workspace that Compose can't set up, so `docker compose up` on it gives a bare container. isopod reads a few fields back on `reconfigure` (`ports`, `mem_limit`, `cpus`, `x-isopod-color`); the rest is a managed reference.

On `reconfigure`, isopod **snapshots the container to an image** (so your workspace *and* anything you `apt install`ed are preserved), then recreates it with the new settings, keeping the box's SSH key, host key, color, and ssh_config entry. The base image itself is that managed snapshot; to change the base, create a new box.

## FAQ

**Why SSH instead of the Dev Containers extension?** The Dev Containers extension is Microsoft-proprietary and not licensed for VSCodium. The open-source `Open Remote – SSH` extension is mature, and the same container works for VSCodium, Cursor, Windsurf, JetBrains, and plain terminals simultaneously.

**Is my code safe from the AI vendor?** Whatever code is in the container is visible to agents you run in it, and they may transmit it to their APIs — that's how they work. Isopod limits the blast radius to the container's contents; it does not change what an agent does with those contents.

**Can two IDEs attach to the same container?** Yes — it's just SSH. You can have VSCodium and a terminal and JetBrains attached at once.

## Testing

isopod ships a test suite under `test/` using [bats-core](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and pexpect for interactive prompts.

```sh
test/run.sh              # lint + stubbed bats + interactive (no container engine)
RUN_LIVE=1 test/run.sh   # also runs live end-to-end tests against real podman/docker
```

Contributing? Install the ShellCheck + shfmt [pre-commit hooks](docs/development.md) first (`pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install`) so linting and formatting run on every commit.

CI runs on both GitLab and GitHub, kept in lockstep with the same three jobs — a `lint` job (shellcheck + bash syntax + python), a `test` job (stubbed + interactive, runs anywhere), and a manual `live` job that needs a podman-capable runner:

- **GitLab CI/CD** (`.gitlab-ci.yml`) — should run identically under [`gitlab-ci-local`](https://github.com/firecow/gitlab-ci-local) for debugging pipelines on your own machine before pushing.

- **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — run it locally with [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act): `act -j lint`, `act -j test`, or just `act` for both. The `live-isolation` job needs container-in-container and is gated to manual dispatch, so run it the native way instead: `RUN_LIVE=1 test/run.sh`. (An `.actrc` pins a runner image with the tooling the jobs expect.)
